Did this project with 2 other students from Stockholm University. 

It is a program that allows the user to open a map(a background image) and define locations by clicking on it.
The user can also add connections between these locations.
The program can then be used to find a route between two user-selected locations.
Each location has a name(e.g, "kista") and can be connected to other locations.
Each connection has a name(e.g, "Flight") and a travel time.
The connections name and time do not need to be displayed on the map.
The user can define new location by clicking "New place" button then selecting a point on the map.
Already existing locations can by seleced by clicking on them which changes the color.
To create a connnection the user selects two locations by clicking on them.
Once selected they can define a connection between these locations, view or edit the connections details, or print the route between the two locations.
